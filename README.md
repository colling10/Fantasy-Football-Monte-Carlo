# Fantasy-Football-Monte-Carlo

This code is to find the probability of what place each team will finish in at the end of the fantasy football regular season.

There is an input txt file to enter the schedule and scores so far, and an output text file with the probabilities. 
This is my first "big" project with python, so the the input text file must be formatted correctly with no leniency on mispellings. 
Happy to hear comments or feedbacks. Example of required formatting can be found with the python file.
